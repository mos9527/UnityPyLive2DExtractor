# UnityPyLive2DExtractor
General purpose, single-file Unity [Live2D](https://www.live2d.com/) Asset recovery tool built w/ [UnityPy](https://github.com/K0lb3/UnityPy) and [sssekai](https://github.com/mos9527/sssekai)

As the name suggests, this project is heavily inspired by [Perfare/UnityLive2DExtractor](https://github.com/Perfare/UnityLive2DExtractor). With a few key differences:
- All Live2D types that pretains to the asset recovery process are properly implemented. This should help with compatibility issues.
- New (not necessarily better) asset discovery method. Though proven to be more reliable in some cases.

## Usage
- You can download/copy-paste the script from [main.py](https://github.com/mos9527/UnityPyLive2DExtractor/blob/main/main.py) and run it as is, with requisite dependency (i.e. `sssekai`) installed.
- Or, you can use the pre-built executables for Windows from the [Releases](https://github.com/mos9527/UnityPyLive2DExtractor/releases/)
